# Project Status — Reunite 🐾

## Current Phase: Foundation

Reunite is currently in its **foundation phase**.

This stage is focused on establishing the purpose, values, and direction of the project before making technical or architectural decisions.

---

## What This Means

At this moment:

* The core mission and values are defined
* The project is public and open source
* No technologies have been selected yet
* No features or roadmap have been finalized
* No architectural decisions have been made

This is intentional.

Reunite aims to be built with care, not rush.

---

## Contributions During This Phase

During the foundation phase:

* Feature development is **not yet open**
* Technical Pull Requests may be paused or declined
* Feedback, reflections, and general suggestions are welcome

Once the technical direction is defined, contribution guidelines will be updated and active development will begin.

---

## Why This Approach

Reunite exists to help people during emotionally sensitive situations.

Because of this, decisions around:

* Privacy
* Safety
* Accessibility
* Community impact

must be made thoughtfully and responsibly.

Taking time at this stage helps ensure that the project grows in a healthy and sustainable way.

## What’s Next

The next steps include:

* Defining the initial MVP scope
* Choosing appropriate technologies
* Establishing a basic technical architecture
* Opening development contributions

Updates will be shared as the project evolves.

Thank you for your interest, patience, and care.

Reunite is just beginning.
