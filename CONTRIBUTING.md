## 🌱 About Reunite

Reunite is a **social and non-profit open source project** created to help people find their lost pets and reunite families with their beloved companions.

This project was born from a very personal loss.

MrWithe was a black kitten, deeply loved. He got lost, and despite the desire to search for him, fear of walking alone at night, lack of time, and daily responsibilities made the search incomplete. He was not found in time.

That feeling — of wondering *“what if I had been able to do more?”* — became the seed of this project.

Reunite exists so that **no one has to search alone**, and so that lost pets don’t have to suffer on the streets because help arrived too late.
